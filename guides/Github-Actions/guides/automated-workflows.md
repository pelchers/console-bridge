# Automated Workflows Guide

Complete guide to setting up and managing GitHub Actions workflows that run automatically without manual intervention.

---

## üìã Overview

Automated workflows run on schedules or events, enabling:
- **Continuous testing** - Run tests automatically on every change
- **Scheduled maintenance** - Regular cleanup, backups, monitoring
- **Event-driven automation** - React to repository events
- **Unattended operation** - Run for hours/days without supervision
- **Consistent execution** - Never forget routine tasks

---

## üéØ Types of Automated Workflows

### 1. Schedule-Based (Cron)

**Runs at specific times automatically**

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 */3 * * *'  # Every 3 hours
```

**Use cases:**
- Health checks
- Data backups
- Report generation
- Dependency updates
- Cache cleanup
- Monitoring tasks

### 2. Event-Driven

**Runs when specific events occur**

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
  release:
    types: [published]
```

**Use cases:**
- Continuous Integration (CI)
- Automated testing
- Code quality checks
- Deployment pipelines
- Notifications

### 3. Hybrid (Schedule + Events + Manual)

**Combines multiple triggers**

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'  # Daily at midnight
  push:
    branches: [main]
  workflow_dispatch:  # Also allow manual
```

---

## üöÄ Setting Up Automated Workflows

### Step 1: Create Workflow File

**Location:** `.github/workflows/automated-example.yml`

**Basic structure:**
```yaml
name: Automated Example

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 * * * *'  # Every hour
  
  workflow_dispatch:  # Allow manual trigger for testing

jobs:
  automated-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Run automated task
        run: |
          echo "Running automated task at $(date)"
          # Your automation logic here
```

### Step 2: Understand Cron Syntax

**Format:** `minute hour day month day-of-week`

**Common schedules:**

```yaml
# Every hour at minute 0
'0 * * * *'

# Every 3 hours
'0 */3 * * *'

# Every 6 hours
'0 */6 * * *'

# Every 12 hours (noon and midnight)
'0 */12 * * *'

# Every day at midnight
'0 0 * * *'

# Every day at 9 AM
'0 9 * * *'

# Every Monday at 9 AM
'0 9 * * 1'

# Every weekday at 6 PM
'0 18 * * 1-5'

# Every 30 minutes
'*/30 * * * *'

# Every 15 minutes
'*/15 * * * *'
```

**üõ†Ô∏è Tools:**
- **crontab.guru** - Interactive cron scheduler
- **GitHub Actions** - Test with workflow_dispatch first

### Step 3: Configure Workflow

**Add necessary setup steps:**

```yaml
steps:
  # Checkout code (if needed)
  - name: Checkout repository
    uses: actions/checkout@v4
  
  # Setup runtime (if needed)
  - name: Setup Node.js
    uses: actions/setup-node@v4
    with:
      node-version: '20'
  
  # Install dependencies (if needed)
  - name: Install dependencies
    run: npm install
  
  # Your automated task
  - name: Run task
    run: npm run automated-task
```

### Step 4: Add Error Handling

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Run task with error handling
    run: |
      set -e  # Exit on error
      
      echo "Starting automated task..."
      
      if ./scripts/automated-task.sh; then
        echo "‚úÖ Task completed successfully"
      else
        echo "‚ùå Task failed"
        exit 1
      fi
    continue-on-error: false  # Stop workflow on failure
```

### Step 5: Configure Notifications

**On failure (example with GitHub API):**

```yaml
- name: Notify on failure
  if: failure()
  run: |
    echo "Automated workflow failed!"
    echo "Run: ${{ github.run_id }}"
    echo "Workflow: ${{ github.workflow }}"
    # Add your notification logic here
```

## üîß Best Practices

### 1. Always Include Manual Trigger

**Why:** Test before letting it run automatically

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 */3 * * *'
  workflow_dispatch:  # ‚Üê Always include this!
```

**Benefits:**
- Test workflow before schedule activates
- Trigger on-demand when needed
- Debug without waiting for schedule

### 2. Set Appropriate Timeouts

```yaml
jobs:
  automated-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 30  # Prevent hanging workflows
```

**Guidelines:**
- Quick checks: 5-10 minutes
- Builds/tests: 30-60 minutes
- Heavy processing: Up to 360 minutes (max)

### 3. Use Concurrency Control

**Prevent overlapping runs:**

```yaml
concurrency:
  group: automated-workflow
  cancel-in-progress: false  # Let current run finish
```

**Or cancel old runs:**

```yaml
concurrency:
  group: automated-workflow
  cancel-in-progress: true  # Cancel if new run starts
```

### 4. Implement Retry Logic

```yaml
- name: Task with retries
  uses: nick-invision/retry@v2
  with:
    timeout_minutes: 10
    max_attempts: 3
    command: ./scripts/flaky-task.sh
```

### 5. Monitor and Alert

**Create summary:**

```yaml
- name: Create summary
  if: always()
  run: |
    echo "## Workflow Summary" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
    echo "- Status: ${{ job.status }}" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
    echo "- Duration: $(date -u -d @$SECONDS +%T)" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
```

### 6. Manage Artifacts Retention

```yaml
- name: Upload artifacts
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: results
    path: output/
    retention-days: 7  # Don't keep forever!
```

**Retention guidelines:**
- Test results: 7 days
- Build artifacts: 14 days
- Backups: 30+ days
- Reports: 30 days

### 7. Use Caching

**Speed up workflows:**

```yaml
- name: Cache dependencies
  uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: ~/.npm
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-node-
```

### 8. Environment Variables

```yaml
env:
  NODE_ENV: production
  TZ: America/New_York  # Set timezone

jobs:
  automated-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      API_URL: https://api.example.com
```

## üìä Monitoring Automated Workflows

### Viewing Run History

**GitHub Web:**
1. Repository ‚Üí Actions tab
2. Select workflow from left
3. View all runs with status

**GitHub CLI:**
```bash
# List recent runs
gh run list --workflow automated-test.yml --limit 20

# View specific run
gh run view <run-id>
```

### Checking for Failures

**GitHub Web:**
- Failed runs show red X
- Click to view error logs
- Check which step failed

**Email Notifications:**
1. GitHub Settings ‚Üí Notifications
2. Enable "Actions"
3. Choose notification preferences

### Tracking Metrics

**Create dashboard:**
- Note patterns in failures
- Track run durations
- Monitor success rates
- Identify performance issues

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Workflow Not Running on Schedule

**Common causes:**

1. **Repository inactive:**
   - GitHub disables workflows if no activity for 60 days
   - Fix: Make a commit or manually run workflow

2. **Workflow disabled:**
   - Check Actions tab for disabled state
   - Re-enable in Actions settings

3. **Cron syntax error:**
   - Verify at crontab.guru
   - Test with workflow_dispatch first

4. **GitHub Actions quota:**
   - Check if you've exceeded limits
   - Review billing/usage

### Workflow Failing Intermittently

**Debugging steps:**

1. **Add logging:**
```yaml
- name: Debug information
  run: |
    echo "Runner: ${{ runner.os }}"
    echo "Time: $(date)"
    env | sort
```

2. **Check external dependencies:**
   - API rate limits
   - Network issues
   - Service availability

3. **Add retries:**
   - Use retry action
   - Implement custom retry logic

### Resource Constraints

**If workflows timeout or fail:**

1. **Optimize workflow:**
   - Use caching
   - Run jobs in parallel
   - Skip unnecessary steps

2. **Split into multiple workflows:**
   - Separate heavy tasks
   - Use workflow dependencies

---

## ‚úÖ Testing Automated Workflows

### Before Scheduling

**Test workflow manually first:**

1. Add workflow_dispatch trigger
2. Run manually several times
3. Verify all steps work
4. Check artifacts created properly
5. Confirm notifications work

### During Initial Period

**Monitor closely:**

1. Watch first few scheduled runs
2. Check for consistent success
3. Verify timing is correct
4. Confirm artifacts handled properly

### Ongoing Maintenance

**Regular checks:**

1. Review run history weekly
2. Investigate failures promptly
3. Update dependencies
4. Optimize as needed
