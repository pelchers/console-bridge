## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Can't find Actions tab"

   - Check Actions permissions
2. **Update GitHub Mobile app:**
   - Check App Store/Play Store for updates

### Issue: "Run workflow button disabled"

**Causes:**
- No `workflow_dispatch` trigger in workflow
- Insufficient permissions (need write access)
- Workflow file has syntax errors
- Branch protection rules blocking

**Check:**
1. Review workflow file on desktop
2. Verify permissions in repository settings
3. Try different branch
4. Contact repository admin

### Issue: "Logs not loading"

**Solutions:**
1. **Check internet connection:**
   - Try WiFi if on cellular

5. **Wait and retry:**
   - Server may be slow
   - Try again in 1-2 minutes

### Issue: "Workflow won't start"

**Debugging:**
1. **Check status.github.com:**
   - GitHub may have issues
   - Check Actions status specifically
2. **Verify on desktop:**
   - Try triggering from web browser
   - Isolates mobile vs GitHub issue
3. **Check repository:**
   - Ensure workflow file exists
   - Verify pushed to GitHub
4. **Review error message:**
   - Screenshot error
   - Share with team if needed

## üìä Best Practices for Mobile

### 1. Enable Notifications
- Don't rely on checking manually
- Get alerted to failures immediately
- Know when long workflows complete

### 2. Use Descriptive Names
```
Good: "Mobile test - payment API v2"
Bad: "test"
```
- Helps identify runs later
- Clear context in notifications
- Easier to find in history

### 3. Monitor Critical Workflows
- Don't just trigger and forget
- Check first few steps succeed
- Verify expected behavior
- React quickly to failures

### 4. Plan Around Network
- Trigger over WiFi when possible
- View logs on WiFi to save data
- Download artifacts on WiFi only
- Cache notification data

### 5. Use Mobile for Monitoring, Desktop for Debugging
- Mobile: Quick checks, triggers, monitoring
- Desktop: Deep log analysis, file editing, complex changes
- Best of both worlds

### 6. Keep App Updated
- Regular updates improve performance
- New features added frequently
- Bug fixes and stability
- Better Actions integration
