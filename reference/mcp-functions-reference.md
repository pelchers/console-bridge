## üñ•Ô∏è CLAUDE'S INTERNAL COMPUTER TOOLS (NOT MCP)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT USE THESE for C:\Claude - they work in Linux container!

**Important:** This is Claude's temporary working directory in a Docker container.
- **Location:** `/home/claude/` - This is NOT cloud storage, NOT your PC
- **Lifecycle:** Files here are TEMPORARY - they may not persist between sessions
- **Conversation History:** IS saved (you can resume chats and see prior messages)
- **Filesystem:** NOT saved (files in /home/claude/ may disappear)
- **Access:** You can only access files by moving them to `/mnt/user-data/outputs/` for download
- **Purpose:** Temporary workspace for Claude to run commands, process files, etc.
- **Think of it as:** Claude's RAM/scratch space - conversation is saved, but files are not guaranteed to persist

**bash_tool** - Run bash commands (Linux environment only)
```
Location: /home/claude/ (NOT your PC!)
Use ONLY when: Explicitly asked to use bash/Linux
```

**view** - View files/directories (Linux environment only)
```
Location: /home/claude/ (NOT your PC!)
```

**str_replace** - String replacement in files (Linux environment)
```
Location: /home/claude/ (NOT your PC!)
```

**create_file** - Create files (Linux environment)
```
Location: /home/claude/ (NOT your PC!)
```

‚úÖ USE: **Filesystem:write_file** to C:\Claude

### When user says: "Create files in my Claude folder"
‚úÖ USE: **Filesystem:write_file** and **Filesystem:create_directory** to C:\Claude

### When user says: "Use bash" or "run this command"
‚úÖ USE: **bash_tool** (they want Linux commands)

### When user says: "Search the web"
‚úÖ USE: **web_search**

### When user says: "Fill this PDF form"
‚úÖ USE: **PDF Tools MCP** (read_pdf_fields, fill_pdf, etc.)

## üîç WHERE FILES GO:

### Filesystem Tools (MCP):
- **Writes to:** C:\Claude\ (YOUR PC)
- **You can access:** Immediately in Windows Explorer

### Claude's Internal Tools (bash, view, etc.):
- **Writes to:** /home/claude/ (Linux container)
- **You can access:** Only via /mnt/user-data/outputs/ for download

---

## üìù EXAMPLES OF CORRECT USAGE:

### ‚úÖ CORRECT - User can access files:
```
User: "Create a file in my Claude folder"
Claude uses: Filesystem:write_file
Result: File appears in C:\Claude\
```

### ‚ùå WRONG - User cannot access files:
```
User: "Create a file in my Claude folder"
Claude uses: bash_tool with /home/claude/
Result: File is in Linux container, not user's PC
```

### ‚úÖ CORRECT - Explicit Linux request:
```
User: "Use bash to process this"
Claude uses: bash_tool
Result: Work done in Linux environment as requested
```

---

## üéì REMEMBER:

1. **Default for C:\Claude = Use Filesystem MCP**
2. **Only use bash/view/create_file when explicitly asked**
3. **When in doubt, ask user: "Should I use Filesystem tools (directly to C:\Claude) or Linux tools?"**
