## Automated Testing (Unattended)

### The Automated Test Workflow

**Schedule:** Runs every 3 hours automatically

**How to verify it's working:**

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Push repository to GitHub
   - Wait for first scheduled run (up to 3 hours)

2. **Check Schedule:**
   ```
   Cron: 0 */3 * * *
   Meaning: Every 3 hours at minute 0
   Times: 12:00 AM, 3:00 AM, 6:00 AM, 9:00 AM, 12:00 PM, 3:00 PM, 6:00 PM, 9:00 PM
   ```

3. **Monitoring:**
   - Check Actions tab periodically
   - Enable email notifications (Settings â†’ Notifications)
   - Use RSS feed for workflow runs

4. **Long-term Testing:**
   - Leave repository for 24 hours
   - Should see 8 automatic runs
   - Check for consistency and errors

### Enabling Notifications:

**GitHub Settings:**
1. Go to github.com/settings/notifications
2. Enable "Actions" notifications
3. Choose: Email, Web, or Mobile
4. Select notification frequency

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

- Check workflow file names match documentation
- Verify files are committed and pushed to GitHub

#### "Workflow disabled"
**Solution:**
- Go to Actions tab

- Or: Settings â†’ Actions â†’ General â†’ Enable actions

#### "Required inputs not provided"
**Solution:**
- Check which inputs are marked `required: true`
- Provide all required parameters when triggering
- Use default values for optional parameters

#### "Permission denied"
**Solution:**
- Check repository permissions (must have write access)
- Verify GitHub token permissions (if using API)
- Ensure Actions are enabled for the repository

#### "Workflow running but no output"
**Solution:**
- Refresh the page
- Check browser console for errors
- Try different browser or incognito mode
- Check GitHub status page for outages

#### "Cannot download artifacts"
**Solution:**
- Artifacts expire after retention period (7-30 days)
- Check if workflow completed successfully
- Verify artifacts section shows files
- Try downloading via CLI: `gh run download <run-id>`

### Platform-Specific Issues:
